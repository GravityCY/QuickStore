# ItemIO
A Fabric mod to allow for easy storing / extracting out of inventories 
without needing to open their inventories.

### Storing
Hold an item, click the keybind (*default:`z`*), and it will put that item 
in the inventory you're looking at!
### Splitting
Hold an Item, hold the keybind, hover over a bunch of inventories and then 
release while looking at one of those inventories, this will split your held item evenly
in each of those inventories!

If you're holding the same item as the inventory's output slot it will instead
of splitting just pull that item into your inventory from each of those inventories 

### Extracting
Have an empty hand, click the keybind, and it will pull 1 stack out of the 
inventory you're looking at! (*tries to prioritize output slots, like the furnace's output slot*)
### Extracting from Multiple
Have an empty hand, hold the keybind, hover over a bunch of inventories, and then 
release while looking at one of those inventories, this will pull 1 stack 
from each of those inventories! (*tries to prioritize output slots, like the furnace's output slot*)
