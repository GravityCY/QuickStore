# ItemIO
A Fabric mod to allow for easy storing / extracting out of inventories 
without needing to open their inventories.

### Storing
Just hold an item, click the keybind (*default:`z`*), and it will put that item 
in the inventory you're looking at!

### Splitting
Hold an Item, hold the keybind, and as you hold the keybind, it will add all the inventories
you're looking at in a list, when you release the keybind while looking at one of those inventories, it will split your 
current item evenly in those inventories!

### Extracting
Have an empty hand, click the keybind, and it will pull an item out of the 
inventory you're looking at! (*tries to prioritize output slots, like the furnace's output slot*)
