# QuickStore
A Fabric mod to allow for easy storing / extracting out of inventories 
without needing to open their inventories.

### Storing
Just hold an item, click the keybind (*default:`z`*), and it will put that item 
in the inventory you're looking at!

### Extracting
Have an empty hand, click the keybind, and it will pull an item out of the 
inventory you're looking at! (*tries to prioritize output slots, like the furnace's output slot*)

### Optional

Hold a modifier keybind (*default:`Left Shift`*) so that you also scroll up in your hotbar after you `store` or `extract`.
